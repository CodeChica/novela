A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…
There were two beautiful women that loved each other very much.
They lived in a thick, enchanting forest where the plants had grown tall and the rivers gleamed with the soft light reflecting into the pools.
Also, one of them had a very, very BIG secret; she could turn into a cupcake if she sticks out her tounge
Anyways, back to the story…
They were both going shopping one day then one of them got lost.
They also forgot where they parked their shopping cart with all of their merchandise in it.
This was a major problem, as they had their cinnamon toast crunch cereal in their shopping cart and needed to find it before breakfast.
They looked around the entire store for an hour looking for the cart.
Then they got kidnapped at the store.
The shopping cart had very important things including; a pink tank-top, some microwavable food, and magnets (all merchandise).
One of them started to panic and accidently turned into a cupcake in the process.
Neither of them knew where to look, so they both turned to the one thing that they believed that out help them find their loved one.
