A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…
There were two beautiful women that loved each other very much.
They lived in a thick, enchanting forest where the plants had grown tall and the rivers gleamed with the soft light reflecting into the pools.
Also, one of them had a very, very BIG secret; she could turn into a cupcake if she sticks out her tounge
Anyways, back to the story…
They were both going shopping one day then one of them got lost.
They also forgot where they parked their shopping cart with all of their merchandise in it.
They looked around the entire store for an hour looking for the cart.
