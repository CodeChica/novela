A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…
There were two beautiful women that loved each other.
They lived in a thick, enchanted forest where the plants had grown tall and the rivers gleamed with the soft light reflecting into the pools.
One of them had a BIG secret; she could turn into a cupcake if she sticks out her tongue.
Anyways, back to the story…
They were both going shopping at their local Walmart one day when one of them got lost.
They also forgot where they parked their shopping cart with all of their merchandise in it.
The shopping cart had important things including; a pink tank-top, some microwavable food, and magnets. (all merchandise)
This was a major problem, as they had their cinnamon toast crunch cereal in their shopping cart and needed to find it before breakfast.
They looked around the entire store for an hour for the cart.
Then they got kidnapped at the store.
One of them started to panic and accidentally turned into a cupcake in the process.
Neither of them knew where to look, so they both turned to the one thing that they believed would help them find their loved one.
The internet. The internet, of course, was only accessible via carrier pigeon.
which took months to come and go but, it was the only way to find their loved one.
So, on their way they went in search of a pigeon to bring their loved one back.
