A long time ago in a galaxy far, far awayâ€¦
There were two beautiful women that loved each other very much.
They lived in a thick, enchanting forest where the plants had grown tall and the rivers gleamed with the soft light reflecting into the pools.
They were both going shopping one day then one of them got lost.
